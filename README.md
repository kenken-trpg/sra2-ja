# Welcome to Shadowrun Anarchy 2 Unofficial System

If you are here, you probably know the world has changed, with technology melting with flesh, mythological creatures and magic raising back from the past.

This system implements Shadowrun Anarchy 2 rules for Foundry VTT.

To run a game, you will need the **Shadowrun Anarchy 2 rule book**.

**[Release Notes](release/)**

- [Catalyst game labs](https://www.catalystgamelabs.com/) -  [Catalyst game labs products](https://store.catalystgamelabs.com/products/) 
- [Black Book Edition](https://www.black-book-editions.fr/) - [Black Book Edition products](https://black-book-editions.fr/catalogue.php?id=150)

## Compendiums

**Important Note:** This is an unofficial fan project and is not officially supported by Catalyst Game Labs or Black Book Editions.

The system is designed to allow you to create everything found in the Shadowrun Anarchy 2 rulebook and more. However, due to copyright restrictions, we cannot provide pre-made compendiums bundled with the system. Users must create their own content based on the official rulebooks they own.

No compendiums are provided to not infringe CGL or BBE copyrights. This may change depending on decision by BBE/CGL. If you have any contact with them, please let us know; we already have compendiums ready to launch.

# Technical Documentation

This section contains technical information for developers who want to contribute to or modify this system.

## Project Structure

This fork targets Foundry VTT v14 and is a system built with TypeScript, Vite, and SCSS.

**🎯 Key Technologies:**
- **TypeScript** for type safety and better developer experience
- **Vite** for fast development and optimized production builds
- **SCSS/SASS** for advanced styling capabilities
- **Foundry VTT v14** runtime APIs (the current type definitions are still for v13)

## Prerequisites

### Node.js

Use **Node.js 24**, matching the CI and release workflows.

## Installation

Once the prerequisites are met, install the project dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

This command will fetch and install all necessary packages required for the project to run.

## Development Setup

### Foundry Configuration

1. Ensure Foundry VTT v14 is running locally on port 30000
2. Link `<foundrydata>/systems/sra2-ja` to the `public` directory of your repository

```bash
# Start Foundry v14 command (Example)
node main.js --dataPath=<path_to_foundry_data>/foundrydata --port=30000
```

When Foundry starts in the backend (Node.js), it will detect the necessary files in the public directory of the repository (these files are `systems/sra2-ja/index.mjs` and `systems/sra2-ja/style/sra2.css`).

When you connect to Foundry from a browser (frontend), Vite will intercept all requests and redirect them to Foundry, except for requests to `systems/sra2-ja`. These files will be served by the Vite project.

### Development Mode

To start the project in development mode with hot-reload:

```bash
npm run dev:server
```

This will launch a Vite development server that is configured to intercept calls made to **systems/sra2-ja** and proxy them appropriately, while serving all other files directly from Foundry.

Alternatively, for building to public directory with watch mode:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Building for Production

### Standard Build

To build the project for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

This compiles TypeScript and assets into static files in the `./dist` directory.

### Build to Public Directory

To build directly to the `public` directory:

```bash
npm run build:public
```

### Release Archive

To build into `dist/` and package the fresh output as `foundry-sra2-ja-v<version>.zip`:

```bash
npm run build:release
```

The archive excludes compendiums and source maps. It does not package the committed
`public/` bundle, so forgetting `build:public` cannot ship stale code. The `zip`
command is required (also available in the CI runner).

## Type Checking

### Verify TypeScript Types

To verify TypeScript types without building:

```bash
npm run typecheck
```

### Type Check AND Build

To check types before building:

```bash
npm run build:check
```

## TypeScript

This project uses TypeScript for enhanced development experience.

### Key TypeScript Files

- `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript configuration
- `src/types/foundry.d.ts` - Foundry VTT type definitions
- `src/types/global.d.ts` - Custom global type extensions
- `src/module/models/` - TypeScript model definitions

### TypeScript Configuration

All source files use TypeScript (`.ts` extension). The build process automatically compiles them to JavaScript. TypeScript provides:

- Type safety for Foundry VTT APIs
- Better IDE autocomplete and IntelliSense
- Compile-time error detection
- Enhanced refactoring capabilities

## SCSS Support

This project includes full SCSS/SASS support for styling:

- **Main styles**: `src/styles/global.scss` - Global styles imported in `src/start.ts`
- **Auto-compilation**: SCSS files are automatically compiled to CSS during build
- **Hot reload**: Style changes are instantly reflected in development mode
- **Sourcemaps**: CSS sourcemaps are generated for easier debugging

### Using SCSS

Simply import SCSS files in your TypeScript modules:

```typescript
import "./styles/my-styles.scss";
```

Or add styles to `src/styles/global.scss` which is already imported in the main entry point.

### Advanced Configuration

The Vite configuration (`vite.config.ts`) includes SCSS preprocessor options. You can add global variables or mixins by uncommenting and modifying the `additionalData` option in the CSS configuration.

## Compendiums Management

Compendium sources are located in `src/packs`. Content is stored in JSON format.

### Available Commands

**Pack compendiums to public folder:**
```bash
npm run pack:compendiums
```
or
```bash
node ./tools/compendium/packCompendiumsToPublic.mjs
```

**Extract compendiums from public folder:**

After changing content on the running server, use this to update the source files:

```bash
npm run unpack:compendiums
```
or
```bash
node ./tools/compendium/extractCompendiumsFromPublic.mjs
```

## Vite Configuration

The Vite server is configured to:
- Handle specific API calls to **systems/sra2-ja** directly for development efficiency
- Forward all other requests to the local Foundry server
- Provide hot module replacement (HMR) for rapid development
- Generate optimized production bundles

## Project Scripts Reference

## Contributing

When contributing to this project:

1. Run `npm run build:check`, `npm test`, and the localization checks. CI requires the whole project to type-check successfully.

3. Test your changes with a local Foundry VTT instance
4. Update documentation as needed
